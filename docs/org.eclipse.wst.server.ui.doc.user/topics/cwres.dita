<p id="cwres_p1">If a server has server configuration files, in most situations,
these server configuration files are created for you automatically and contained
in a server project.</p>
<section id="cwres_server_project"><title>Server Project</title><p>A <i>server
project</i> contains servers and server configuration files. When a server
project is created automatically by the workbench, the name given to the project
is <uicontrol>Servers</uicontrol> and is available in the Project Explorer
view.</p></section>
<section id="cwres_servers"><title id="cwres_servers_title">Server</title><p
id="cwres_servers_p1">A <i>server</i> identifies where you want to test or
publish your application. A server points to a specific runtime environment
such as a local test environment, a full installation of a server, or a server
on another machine. A server contains the logic of how to publish to the server;
and what application projects and configurations to run.</p><p id="cwres_servers_p2">On
the workbench, when the metadata of the server is automatically created, it
is stored in a <i>serverName</i>.server file, where <i>serverName</i> is the
name assigned to the server. For details on the metadata of the server, refer
to the <i>Displaying or hiding the metadata of the server</i> link at the
bottom of this topic.</p></section>
<section><title id="cwres_serverconfig_title">Server configurations</title><p
id="cwres_serverconfig_p1"><ph>Server configurations are files that contain
information to set up and publish to a server. For example, these files may
include information about what port to run the server, security preferences
and other vendor-specific server settings.</ph></p><p id="cwres_serverconfig_p2">On
the workbench, the metadata of the server configurations is automatically
created and stored in a <i>configuration data folder</i> under a server project.
The naming convention of the configuration data folder is dependant on the
vendor, typically it has the following convention: <i>serverName</i>@<i>hostname</i>-config,
where <i>serverName</i> is the name assigned to the server, and <i>hostname</i> is
the fully qualified DNS name or IP address of the host machine where the server
is running.</p></section>
<section id="cwres_installed_runtime"><title>Server Runtime Environment</title>You
need to define the runtime environment of an application server for compiling
your application. A server contains a reference to a server runtime environment
it is currently using. For details on how to define a server runtime environment,
refer to the <i>Defining the server runtime environments <?Pub Caret?>preference</i> link
at the bottom of this topic.</section>
<section id="cwres_relationship"><title>Relationship between the resources</title><p>For
each server, you can specify the server configuration and server runtime environment
that should be used for that server. A server can only point to one or no
server configuration. However, a server configuration can be pointed from
one or more servers.</p><p>A relationship between a server configuration and
an application project, for example an EAR project, is created when a project
is added to the server configuration. A server can point to one or more projects.
A project can be pointed from one or more server configurations.</p></section>
