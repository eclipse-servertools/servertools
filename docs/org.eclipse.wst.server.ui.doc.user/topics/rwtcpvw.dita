<uicontrol>Other</uicontrol><uicontrol>Debug</uicontrol><uicontrol>TCP/IP

<li>List of Requests pane. Located on the top of the TCP/IP Monitor view,
this pane contains a list of requests sent to the application server.</li>
<li>Request pane. Located on the left of the TCP/IP Monitor view, this pane
contains information about the request when it is forwarded to the application
server.</li>
<li>Response pane. Located on the right side of the TCP/IP Monitor view, this
pane contains information about the response when it is received from the
application server.</li>
</ul><p>In the List of Requests pane, requests such as JSP files, servlets,
and URLs are grouped and displayed by the host machine. Selecting a request
displays the appropriate information about the request in the Request pane
and the Response pane. The  <i>response time</i> is the elapsed time that
it takes for a request to arrive at the TCP/IP Monitor until the response
is forwarded from the server.</p></section>
