<h1 class="topictitle1">Debugging a JSP file on a server</h1>
<div><p>The debugger enables you to detect and diagnose errors in your

application. It allows you to control the execution of your program by setting

breakpoints, suspending threads, stepping through the code, and examining

the contents of the variables. You can debug a JavaServer Pages (JSP) without

losing the state of your application. </p><div class="skipspace">To debug a JSP file on a server:</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>In the Project Explorer view, open your JSP file.</span> In

a Web project, JSP files are located in the Web Content folder. Double-click

the JSP file to open it on the JSP editor.</li>
<p>To set one or more breakpoints, you can select a line of code in the editor and double-click the marker

bar directly to the left of the line where you want to add the breakpoint.</p>
</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>From the JSP file's context menu in the Project Explorer view,

click  <span class="uicontrol">Debug As &gt; Debug on Server.</span> The workbench switches

to the Debug perspective and the server is launched in debug mode.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Debug view, step through the code and make the necessary

changes to the JSP file.</span> For detailed information on debugging,

refer to the Debugging Java™ applications documentation.</li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Save the JSP file.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Click the  <span class="uicontrol">Refresh</span> icon in the Web Browser

to update the changes.</span> The state of your application is not lost

and the server recognizes your changes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span><ul><li>If you are running the JSP file on a remote WebSphere<sup>®</sup> server,

the JSP cache directory must be cleared in order to force the class file to

be in the correct JSP source debug mode. If the cache is not cleared, some

compiled unchanged JSP files may still be compiled in the previous JSP source

debug mode.</li>
