<h1 class="topictitle1">TCP/IP Monitor view</h1>



<div><p>The TCP/IP Monitor is a simple server that monitors
all the requests and the responses between a Web browser and server. If you
want the TCP/IP Monitor view to open when there is TCP/IP activity, select
the  <span class="uicontrol">Show TCP/IP Monitor view when there is activity</span> check
box on the TCP/IP Monitor preferences page (  <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window </span>
 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Run/Debug</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">TCP/IP Monitor</span></span>).</p>

<div class="section" id="rwtcpvw_wst__section"><a name="rwtcpvw_wst__section"><!-- --></a><p>You can monitor the TCP/IP activity using the TCP/IP
Monitor view (<span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Show View</span>
 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Other</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Debug</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">TCP/IP
Monitor</span></span>). This view consists of the three panes:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of Requests pane. Located on the top of the TCP/IP Monitor view,
this pane contains a list of requests sent to the application server.</li>

<li>Request pane. Located on the left of the TCP/IP Monitor view, this pane
contains information about the request when it is forwarded to the application
server.</li>

<li>Response pane. Located on the right side of the TCP/IP Monitor view, this
pane contains information about the response when it is received from the
application server.</li>

</ul>
<p>In the List of Requests pane, requests such as JSP files, servlets,
and URLs are grouped and displayed by the host machine. Selecting a request
displays the appropriate information about the request in the Request pane
and the Response pane. The  <em>response time</em> is the elapsed time that
it takes for a request to arrive at the TCP/IP Monitor until the response
is forwarded from the server.</p>
