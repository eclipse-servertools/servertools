<h1 class="topictitle1">TCP/IP Monitor view</h1>
<div><p>The TCP/IP Monitor is a simple server that monitors all the requests
and the responses between a Web browser and server. If you want the TCP/IP
Monitor view to open when there is TCP/IP activity, select the  <span class="uicontrol">Show
TCP/IP Monitor view when there is activity</span> check box on the TCP/IP
Monitor preferences page (  <span class="uicontrol">Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Internet &gt; TCP/IP
Monitor</span>).</p><div class="section"><p>You can monitor the TCP/IP activity using the TCP/IP Monitor view
(<b>Windows  Show View &gt; Other &gt; Debug &gt; TCP/IP Monitor</b>).
This view consists of the three panes:</p>
<ul><li>List of Requests pane. Located on the top of the TCP/IP Monitor view,
this pane contains a list of requests sent to the application server.</li>
<li>Request pane. Located on the left of the TCP/IP Monitor view, this pane
contains information about the request when it is forwarded to the application
server.</li>
<li>Response pane. Located on the right side of the TCP/IP Monitor view, this
pane contains information about the response when it is received from the
application server.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the List of Requests pane, requests such as JSP files, servlets,
and URLs are grouped and displayed by the host machine. Selecting a request
displays the appropriate information about the request in the Request pane
and the Response pane. The  <em>response time</em> is the elapsed time that
it takes for a request to arrive at the TCP/IP Monitor until the response
is forwarded from the server.</p>
