can start the server automatically as part of running a selected resource
on the server, or you can simply start the server without running
resources on the server. For example, the server is automatically
started when you right-click a project or an application resource
in the Project Explorer view and select <menucascade><uicontrol>Run
As</uicontrol><uicontrol>Run on Server</uicontrol></menucascade>.

<p id="cwflow_p1">When you run a file or project, the Server Tools
first verify that the servers and configurations for that particular
resource are already set up and determines how many are defined. You
are then prompted by the Run on Server dialog box to select a server.</p>
<section id="cwflow_section1"><title>Run on Server</title><p>If this
is the first time you are testing a file or project, you will be prompted
to create a new server. The Run on Server dialog box presents you
with two options for deciding which server to run:</p><ul>
<li> <uicontrol>Choose an existing server</uicontrol> This list includes
servers that may or may not have already been configured. If you choose
a server that is not already configured, it will be configured automatically
and might be restarted if the server is already running.</li>
<li> <uicontrol>Manually define a server</uicontrol> This option will
create a new server and server configuration before testing.</li>
</ul><p>If this is the first time you are testing a file or project,
 <uicontrol>Manually define a server</uicontrol> is selected for you
by default. When you select the type of server and click  <uicontrol
>Next</uicontrol>, a server will be automatically created for you
and the server will start.</p></section>
