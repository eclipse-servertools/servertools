<h1 class="topictitle1">Starting a server</h1>
<div><p>When you are ready to test your projects, you must start a server.
In some situations, listed below, the server tools start a server for you
automatically. For more information on which test server will start, refer
to the list of related topics at the end of this topic.</p>
<div class="p"><b>Prerequisites</b>
<ul>
<li><a href="twcrtins.html#twcrtins">Create a server.</a></li>
<li>Add a project to the server.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="skipspace"><p>Once you have started the server you can test the projects that
are associated with the server. You can stop and restart the server at any
time. The status of the server is displayed in the  <span class="uicontrol">Status</span> column
of the Servers view.</p>
<p>To manually start a server:</p>
</div>
<ol><li class="skipspace"><span>Switch to the Servers view.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>In the Servers view, right-click the server you want to start.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select  <span class="uicontrol">Start</span>. </span> The following
things happen:<ul><li>If you have selected the  <span class="uicontrol">Automatically publish before starting
servers</span> check box on the Server preferences page (Window &gt; Preferences
&gt; Server), the server tools check to see if your project and files on the
server are synchronized prior to starting the server. If they are not, the
project and the files are automatically updated on the remote server when
it is started.</li>
<li>A Console view opens in the workbench. It will take a minute to start
the server. If the server fails to start, check for the reason that it failed
in the Console.</li>
<li>In the  <span class="uicontrol">Status</span> column of the Servers view, the
status of the server changes to  <tt class="sysout">Started</tt>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="skipspace"><div class="tip"><span class="tiptitle">Tip: </span>The server is automatically started when you right-click
on a file and then select  <span class="uicontrol">Run &gt; Run on Server</span>.</div>
