<h1 class="topictitle1">Publishing your application</h1>
<div><p>In this product, publishing involves copying files (projects, resource

files, and server configurations) to the correct location for the server to

find and use them. In the test environments, these files may already be in

the correct location. In some cases, temporary copies of the server configurations

may be created.</p>
<p>You can either publish your application automatically or manually.

If the  <span class="uicontrol">Automatically publish before starting servers</span> check

box on the Server preferences page ( <span class="uicontrol">Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Server</span>)

is selected, the server tools check to see if your project and files on the

server are synchronized. If they are not, the project and the files are automatically

updated when the server is either started or restarted.</p>

<p>To publish your application manually you can

complete one of the following in the Servers view:</p>
</div>
<ul><li><span>Select the server and then click the  <span class="uicontrol">Publish to the

server</span>  <img src="../images/launch_publish.gif" alt="Picture of Publish toolbar icon" /> icon

located on the toolbar.</span></li>
<li><span>Right-click the server and then select  <span class="uicontrol">Publish</span>.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>All the projects defined in the

server configuration that are associated with the selected server are published.

The resources in these projects are transferred to the location that is defined

by the server.</p>
<!-- <p>The Publishing Details dialog box appears allowing you

to monitor the projects and files being published by displaying their status.

Click  <span class="uicontrol">Details</span> to display more detailed information

in a scrollable box at the bottom of this dialog. The Publishing Details dialog

box automatically closes when publishing completes. If you want to leave this

dialog open after publishing, select the  <span class="uicontrol">Keep publishing dialog

open after publishing</span> check box on the Server preferences page.</p>
