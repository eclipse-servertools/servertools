<h1 class="topictitle1">Publishing your application</h1>



<div><p><em>Publishing</em> involves copying
files (projects, resource files, and server configurations) to the
correct location for the server to find and use them. In the test
environments, these files may already be in the correct location.
In some cases, temporary copies of the server configurations may be
created. You can either publish your application automatically or
manually.</p>

<div class="section"><strong id="twpub_wst__twpub_autotitle"><a name="twpub_wst__twpub_autotitle"><!-- --></a>Automatically publishing to a server</strong><p id="twpub_wst__twpub_auto1"><a name="twpub_wst__twpub_auto1"><!-- --></a>If the <span class="uicontrol">Automatically publish when starting

</span>) is selected, the workbench checks to see if your project
and files on the server are synchronized. If they are not, the project
and the files are automatically updated when the server is either
started or restarted.</p>
<p id="twpub_wst__twpub_p2"><a name="twpub_wst__twpub_p2"><!-- --></a>To publish your application
manually you can complete one of the following in the Servers view:</p>
<div class="p" id="twpub_wst__twpub_auto2"><a name="twpub_wst__twpub_auto2"><!-- --></a>In the workbench, you have several options to choose
for the <em>Publishing</em> settings. You can set these <em>Publishing</em> settings
by going into the Servers view, right-click the server and select <span class="uicontrol">Open</span>.
The Server editor opens. In the <em>Overview</em> page of the server
editor, under the <span class="uicontrol">Publishing</span> settings, you
are going to find the following settings:<ul>
<li><span class="uicontrol">Never publish automatically</span>: Specifies
the workbench should never publish files to the server.</li>

<li><span class="uicontrol">Automatically publish when resources change</span>:
Specifies the workbench to issue a publish after changes on a file
that is associated to the server are saved and a full time interval
has passed in the <span class="uicontrol">Publishing interval</span> setting.</li>

<li><span class="uicontrol">Automatically publish after a build event</span>:
Specifies the workbench to issue a publish after changes on a file
that requires a build and is associated to the server are saved, and
a full time interval has passed in the <span class="uicontrol">Publishing interval</span> setting.</li>

<li><span class="uicontrol">Publishing interval (in seconds)</span>: Specifies
the number of <em>seconds</em> that needs to pass before the workbench
calls a publish to happen on the server. However, if you make a subsequent
change to the files before this time interval has completed, the publish
is delayed as the timer is reset. The workbench makes a publish to
the server only after the full time interval has passed.  If you set
the publishing interval to 0 seconds, an immediate publish should
happen after changes on a file are saved.</li>

</ul>

<p id="twpub_wst__twpub_auto3"><a name="twpub_wst__twpub_auto3"><!-- --></a>In the workbench, the default setting
is the <strong>Automatically publish when resources change</strong> option is
enabled with a value set in the publishing interval.</p>

under the <span class="uicontrol">Select publishing actions</span> list, select
the tasks you want to run during publishing.</p>

interval to pass, at anytime you can manually request the workbench
to issue a publish command to the server. Each manual publish command
causes a single publishing request to the server. To publish your
application manually you can complete one of the following in the
Servers view:</p>
<div class="p"><ul>
