<h1 class="topictitle1">Resources used to test and publish on your server</h1>



<div><p>To test and publish on your server, you need
to define one or more of the following resources:</p>

<a name="cwres_wst__cwres_ul"><!-- --></a><ul id="cwres_wst__cwres_ul">
<li>A server</li>

<li>A server runtime environment</li>

</ul>

<p id="cwres_wst__cwres_p1"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_p1"><!-- --></a>If a server has server configuration files, in most situations,
these server configuration files are created for you automatically and contained
in a server project.</p>

<div class="section" id="cwres_wst__cwres_server_project"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_server_project"><!-- --></a><h4 class="sectiontitle">Server Project</h4><p>A <em>server
project</em> contains servers and server configuration files. When a server
project is created automatically by the workbench, the name given to the project
is <span class="uicontrol">Servers</span> and is available in the Project Explorer
view.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="cwres_wst__cwres_servers"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_servers"><!-- --></a><h4 class="sectiontitle">Server</h4><p id="cwres_wst__cwres_servers_p1"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_servers_p1"><!-- --></a>A <em>server</em> identifies where you want to test or
publish your application. A server points to a specific runtime environment
such as a local test environment, a full installation of a server, or a server
on another machine. A server contains the logic of how to publish to the server;
and what application projects and configurations to run.</p>
<p id="cwres_wst__cwres_servers_p2"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_servers_p2"><!-- --></a>On
the workbench, when the metadata of the server is automatically created, it
is stored in a <em>serverName</em>.server file, where <em>serverName</em> is the
name assigned to the server. For details on the metadata of the server, refer
to the <em>Displaying or hiding the metadata of the server</em> link at the
bottom of this topic.</p>
</div>

<div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Server configurations</h4><p id="cwres_wst__cwres_serverconfig_p1"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_serverconfig_p1"><!-- --></a><span>Server configurations are files that contain
information to set up and publish to a server. For example, these files may
include information about what port to run the server, security preferences
and other vendor-specific server settings.</span></p>
<p id="cwres_wst__cwres_serverconfig_p2"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_serverconfig_p2"><!-- --></a>On
the workbench, the metadata of the server configurations is automatically
created and stored in a <em>configuration data folder</em> under a server project.
The naming convention of the configuration data folder is dependant on the
vendor, typically it has the following convention: <em>serverName</em>@<em>hostname</em>-config,
where <em>serverName</em> is the name assigned to the server, and <em>hostname</em> is
the fully qualified DNS name or IP address of the host machine where the server
is running.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="cwres_wst__cwres_installed_runtime"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_installed_runtime"><!-- --></a><h4 class="sectiontitle">Server Runtime Environment</h4>You
need to define the runtime environment of an application server for compiling
your application. A server contains a reference to a server runtime environment
it is currently using. For details on how to define a server runtime environment,
refer to the <em>Defining the server runtime environments preference</em> link
at the bottom of this topic.</div>

<div class="section" id="cwres_wst__cwres_relationship"><a name="cwres_wst__cwres_relationship"><!-- --></a><h4 class="sectiontitle">Relationship between the resources</h4><p>For
each server, you can specify the server configuration and server runtime environment
that should be used for that server. A server can only point to one or no
server configuration. However, a server configuration can be pointed from
one or more servers.</p>
<p>A relationship between a server configuration and
an application project, for example an EAR project, is created when a project
is added to the server configuration. A server can point to one or more projects.
A project can be pointed from one or more server configurations.</p>
