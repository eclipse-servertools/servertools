<description>To share the same server between two machines, use a class path variable to point to an external JAR file. For example, an external JAR file called db2java.zip may reside in the c:/test drive directory on one machine and on the d:/ drive on another. In the Java Class Path Variables Preference page, define TEMP=c:/temp on the first machine and then define TEMP=d:/ on the second machine. Create a class path variable entry called TEMP with an extension of db2java.zip for that server.
