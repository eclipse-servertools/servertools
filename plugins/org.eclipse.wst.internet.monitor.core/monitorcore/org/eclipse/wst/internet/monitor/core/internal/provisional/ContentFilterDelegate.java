/**
 * A content filter that filters contents from the monitor traffic on a request.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class is intended to be subclassed only by clients
 * to extend the <code>contentFilters</code> extension point.
 * The subclass must have a public 0-argument constructor, which will be used
 * automatically to instantiate the delegate when required. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: The notion of content filters is a UI/presentation
 * concern, not something that is makes sense to have as core
 * functionality. The contentFilters extension point, IContentFilter,
 * and ContentFilterDelegate should all move to the o.e.wst.internet.monitor.ui
 * plug-in.]
 * [issue: CS - I'd echo the comment above that this seems like a UI concern.  
 * I noticed there's also a viewer on the UI side, so i'm not sure how these would interact. 
 * I assume that filters operate on the byte stream and aren't concerned with UI presentation...
 * but usually UI's and filters are tightly coupled.
