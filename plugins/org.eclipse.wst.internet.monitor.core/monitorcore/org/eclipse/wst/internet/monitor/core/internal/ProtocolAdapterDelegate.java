/**
 * Abstract base class for protocol adapter delegates, which provide the
 * implementation behind a particular protocol adapter.
 * A protocol adapter watches the message traffic passing between client and
 * server; it parses the messages and reports them in the form of
 * Request objects.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class is intended to be subclassed only by clients
 * to extend the <code>protocolAdapters</code> extension point.
 * The subclass must have a public 0-argument constructor, which will be used
 * automatically to instantiate the delegate when required.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There is only one delegate created per protocol, and this delegate must
 * be able to handle multiple monitor instances. This means that the delegate
 * typically will not have instance state, or must synchronize and keep the
 * state separate.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: The HTTP and TCP/IP delegate implementations create threads which
 * shuffle info between sockets. If the monitor is changed or deleted, how do
 * these threads go away? Methinks that delegates in general should be forced
 * to implement disconnect(IMonitor) as well. This method would be called by the
 * system when the monitor is changed or deleted, or when the plug-in is
 * being shut down.]
