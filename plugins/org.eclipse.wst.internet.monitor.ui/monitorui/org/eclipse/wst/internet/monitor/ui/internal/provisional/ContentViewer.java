/**
 * Editable viewer for displaying and editing requests and responses.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class is intended to be subclassed only by clients
 * to extend the <code>contentViewers</code> extension point.
 * The subclass must have a public 0-argument constructor, which will be used
 * automatically to instantiate the viewer when required.
 * Once instantiated, {@link #init(Composite)} is called to create
 * the viewer's controls. Then {@link #setContent(byte[])} is called,
 * one or more times, to cause the viewer to display particular
 * content. Finally, when the viewer is no longer needed, {@link #dispose()}
 * is called to free up any resources tied up by the viewer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [issue: It's unclear how these content viewers are used.
 * Is it just that the UI provides a list of available
 * views for the user to make a manual selection from, regardless
 * of the actual content of the message traffic?]
 * </p>
 * [issue: CS - If a ContentViewer is editable, does that mean we can edit the 
 * bytes of the message and resend it across the wire?  How is an editable ContentViewer
 * handled differently by the framework? Perhaps an example of what an editeable viewer would do. ]
