<abstract>Utility classes for the server tools framework.</abstract>

<p>PingThread is a utility class for pinging a server to determine if
it is running and updating the server's state.</p>

<p>SocketUtil contains utility methods for determining if ports are
free and whether a given hostname is a local hostname.</p>

<p>The four XXXAdapter classes are implementations of server tools
listener interfaces with the method bodies stubbed in; they can be
subclassed by clients who only want to implement a single listener
interface method.</p>

<p>ServerPort, Task, and TaskModel are standard implementations of
other interface classes.</p>
