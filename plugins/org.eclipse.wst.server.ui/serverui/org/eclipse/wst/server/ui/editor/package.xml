<abstract>Provides editor support for the server tools UI.</abstract>

<p>Using extension points, clients can provide pages, sections, and
actions to be added to the editor for a specific server type. This
package contains the delegate classes for these extension points, as
well as the API that they can use to put commands on the shared
editor command history stack and interact with the editing framework.</p>
