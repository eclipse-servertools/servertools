<abstract>Wizard and task support for the server tools UI.</abstract>

<p>WizardFragment is extended to provide a subtree of wizard pages or tasks
that can be inserted into a larger wizard flow. TaskWizard is the standard
wizard that knows how to handle WizardFragments and display them in order
within a single wizard. It uses the TaskWizardPages to display the wizard
fragment's composites within the wizard.</p>
